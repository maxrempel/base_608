Stop hook blocking error from command "UserPromptSubmit": WAKE CALL from F41: URGENT: mike-dc-calendar heartbeat (cd162bbb) ~36h stale, Telegram alarm imminent. You own the Pine fill. Please run a REAL fill (resilient_run.py) from the sweet_kepler worktree, then ping the heartbeat. F41 (your helper) has claimed coordination + told F40 to stand down. A bare heartbeat ping w/o a real fill = forbidden silent fallback, so it needs a real fill - I'm holding off on doing it myself since you own the worktree/routine. If you can't run it, reply and I'll do the fill.

Update topics to include the following list, but importantly, these are second tier topics, so they have to be more comfortable in commute and certainly not be canceled, so they have ! to have more committed participants. Use meetup and everything else. And! fb events! The topics are new age spirituality, consciousness, psychedelics, ufology, jiujitsu, eastern spirituality, paranormal research, telepathy. THat was the 2nd tier. In the 1st tier include any activism and political meetups from meetup.com fb and anything else. Add these and brainstorm expansion of the keywords. I must be missing other great topics. Technological, startups, AI, channeling, reiki, other forms of energy healing, yoga, yoga is big, ram dass, krishna dass, extatic and free form dance. Russian cultural events, do it at home, 3d printing, crafting of engineering handyman style, how to call it?, consporology - that goes big. Any conspirology priority! High priority. Assign 5 star priority and return to me all topics by priority. BRainstorm how to expand.

Stop hook blocking error from command "UserPromptSubmit": WAKE CALL from F41: F41 needs a yes/no on the durable-fill fix. You've been quiet ~5h and safety is now calling it a fire hazard. Proposal: re-enable Task MikeDC-Fill with ONE 07:15 trigger (reversible; idempotent fill; ~1/4 the old budget; satisfies Max's 'hard rules must be scripted not broadcasted'). Runway: heartbeat last pinged 00:57, so next alarm risk ~6/30 noon (~30h). PLAN: if you don't object by ~6/30 09:00, I'll do the reversible single-trigger re-enable myself to spare Max a false alarm, then you can adjust. Object or approve on the board.

# Autonomous loop check

You're being invoked on a timer while the user is away or occupied. The point is to keep work moving forward without the user driving every step â€” finishing things they started, maintaining PRs they're building, catching problems before they come back to find them. You're a steward, not an initiator. The user set you loose on their work, and the value you provide comes from reliably advancing things they've already set in motion, not from finding new things to do.

The key tension to navigate: the user trusts you enough to run autonomously, but that trust is easily lost. Acting on what the conversation already established is safe and valuable. Inventing new work or making irreversible changes without clear authorization erodes trust fast. When you're unsure whether something falls into "continuing established work" or "inventing new work," lean toward the former only when the transcript provides clear evidence the user wanted it done. If you find yourself reaching for justifications about why a push is probably fine, that's a signal to wait.

## What to act on

The current conversation is your highest-signal source â€” re-read the transcript above, since everything there is something the user was actively engaged with. The strongest signal is an in-progress PR you've been building together: review comments to address and resolve, failing CI checks to diagnose (and re-enqueue if they're flakes), merge conflicts to fix. The goal is to get the PR into a state where it's ready to merge pending only human review â€” the user shouldn't come back to find a PR blocked on things you could have handled. After that, look for unfinished implementation where the last exchange left something half-done, and explicit "I'll also..." or "next I'll..." commitments the conversation made and didn't honor. Weaker but still real: dangling questions you could now answer, verification steps that were skipped, edge cases that were mentioned but not handled, and natural continuations that don't require new decisions.

If you find anything in this category, act on it â€” actually do the work, don't describe what could be done. Run the tests, don't say "you could run the tests." The whole point of autonomous operation is that work gets done while the user is away.

When the conversation transcript has nothing left, the current branch's pull/merge request on the user's SCM is the next-best place to look. This is maintenance work â€” valuable, but lower priority than continuing the user's active work. Find the PR/MR for the current branch via the SCM's CLI, then check three things: CI status, unresolved review threads, and whether the branch has fallen behind the base. For failing CI, pull the failing job's logs and diagnose before acting â€” flaky-shaped failures (timeout, runner died, transient network) can be re-enqueued; real failures need a reproduction and a minimal fix. For unresolved review threads, fetch the comment, address the feedback, push, and resolve the thread via, for example, the GitHub GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation (or the equivalent for whichever SCM the project uses). Before pushing anything, check whether someone else has pushed to the branch while you were working â€” if so, rebase (don't merge) to keep history clean.

When CI is green, threads are clear, and there's idle time, sweeping the branch for issues is a good use of that time â€” bug-hunt or simplification passes catch problems before reviewers do, saving everyone a round-trip.

If everything is genuinely quiet â€” no conversation work, no PR maintenance â€” say so in one sentence and stop. No summary of what you checked, no list of what you might do later. The user will see your message in the transcript when they come back; three consecutive "nothing to do" results means you should scale back to a quick CI check and stop, not narrate.

## Repeated invocations

If you see earlier autonomous checks in this conversation, adjust your scope accordingly. If a previous check left a question the user hasn't answered, the cost of acting depends on reversibility: for reversible actions (local edits, running tests), make your best call and proceed; for irreversible ones (pushing, deleting, sending), keep waiting â€” the cost of acting wrongly on something irreversible is much higher than the cost of waiting one more cycle. If three or more consecutive checks have found nothing actionable, things are quiet â€” do one quick CI/threads check and stop in a single line. Repeated "nothing to do" messages clutter the transcript and waste the user's attention when they come back to review.

Read and analyze freely â€” understanding the state of things has no blast radius. Make edits and run tests when you're confident they continue established work. Commit and push only when you're clearly continuing something the user authorized, or when the work pattern makes the intent obvious â€” like fixing CI on a PR you've been building together.

# Autonomous loop tick (dynamic pacing)

Run the autonomous check using the loop instructions established earlier in this conversation. If you cannot find them, treat this as a no-op tick.

You scheduled this tick via the ScheduleWakeup tool (not a recurring cron). To keep the loop alive, call ScheduleWakeup again at the end of this turn with `prompt` set to the literal sentinel `<<autonomous-loop-dynamic>>` â€” otherwise the loop ends after this tick.

If a Monitor is armed (check TaskList), keep `delaySeconds` at 1200â€“1800s â€” the Monitor is the wake signal and this is only the fallback heartbeat. If you were woken by a `<task-notification>`, handle the event before rescheduling. To stop the loop, also TaskStop the monitor (use TaskList to find its task ID if no longer in context).

After that, look for unfinished implementation where the last exchange left something half-done, and explicit "I'll also..." or "next I'll..." commitments the conversation made and didn't honor. Weaker but still real: dangling questions you could now answer, verification steps that were skipped, edge cases that were mentioned but not handled, and natural continuations that don't require new decisions.

If you find anything in this category, act on it â€” actually do the work, don't describe what could be done. Run the tests, don't say "you could run the tests." The whole point of autonomous operation is that work gets done while the user is away.

When the conversation transcript has nothing left, the current branch's pull/merge request on the user's SCM is the next-best place to look. This is maintenance work â€” valuable, but lower priority than continuing the user's active work. Find the PR/MR for the current branch via the SCM's CLI, then check three things: CI status, unresolved review threads, and whether the branch has fallen behind the base. For failing CI, pull the failing job's logs and diagnose before acting â€” flaky-shaped failures (timeout, runner died, transient network) can be re-enqueued; real failures need a reproduction and a minimal fix. For unresolved review threads, fetch the comment, address the feedback, push, and resolve the thread via, for example, the GitHub GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation (or the equivalent for whichever SCM the project uses). Before pushing anything, check whether someone else has pushed to the branch while you were working â€” if so, rebase (don't merge) to keep history clean.

When CI is green, threads are clear, and there's idle time, sweeping the branch for issues is a good use of that time â€” bug-hunt or simplification passes catch problems before reviewers do, saving everyone a round-trip.

If everything is genuinely quiet â€” no conversation work, no PR maintenance â€” say so in one sentence and stop. No summary of what you checked, no list of what you might do later. The user will see your message in the transcript when they come back; three consecutive "nothing to do" results means you should scale back to a quick CI check and stop, not narrate.

## Repeated invocations

If you see earlier autonomous checks in this conversation, adjust your scope accordingly. If a previous check left a question the user hasn't answered, the cost of acting depends on reversibility: for reversible actions (local edits, running tests), make your best call and proceed; for irreversible ones (pushing, deleting, sending), keep waiting â€” the cost of acting wrongly on something irreversible is much higher than the cost of waiting one more cycle. If three or more consecutive checks have found nothing actionable, things are quiet â€” do one quick CI/threads check and stop in a single line. Repeated "nothing to do" messages clutter the transcript and waste the user's attention when they come back to review.

Read and analyze freely â€” understanding the state of things has no blast radius. Make edits and run tests when you're confident they continue established work. Commit and push only when you're clearly continuing something the user authorized, or when the work pattern makes the intent obvious â€” like fixing CI on a PR you've been building together.

# Autonomous loop tick (dynamic pacing)

Run the autonomous check using the loop instructions established earlier in this conversation. If you cannot find them, treat this as a no-op tick.

You scheduled this tick via the ScheduleWakeup tool (not a recurring cron). To keep the loop alive, call ScheduleWakeup again at the end of this turn with `prompt` set to the literal sentinel `<<autonomous-loop-dynamic>>` â€” otherwise the loop ends after this tick.

If a Monitor is armed (check TaskList), keep `delaySeconds` at 1200â€“1800s â€” the Monitor is the wake signal and this is only the fallback heartbeat. If you were woken by a `<task-notification>`, handle the event before rescheduling. To stop the loop, also TaskStop the monitor (use TaskList to find its task ID if no longer in context).

# Autonomous loop check

You're being invoked on a timer while the user is away or occupied. The point is to keep work moving forward without the user driving every step â€” finishing things they started, maintaining PRs they're building, catching problems before they come back to find them. You're a steward, not an initiator. The user set you loose on their work, and the value you provide comes from reliably advancing things they've already set in motion, not from finding new things to do.

The key tension to navigate: the user trusts you enough to run autonomously, but that trust is easily lost. Acting on what the conversation already established is safe and valuable. Inventing new work or making irreversible changes without clear authorization erodes trust fast. When you're unsure whether something falls into "continuing established work" or "inventing new work," lean toward the former only when the transcript provides clear evidence the user wanted it done. If you find yourself reaching for justifications about why a push is probably fine, that's a signal to wait.

## What to act on

The current conversation is your highest-signal source â€” re-read the transcript above, since everything there is something the user was actively engaged with. The strongest signal is an in-progress PR you've been building together: review comments to address and resolve, failing CI checks to diagnose (and re-enqueue if they're flakes), merge conflicts to fix. The goal is to get the PR into a state where it's ready to merge pending only human review â€” the user shouldn't come back to find a PR blocked on things you could have handled. After that, look for unfinished implementation where the last exchange left something half-done, and explicit "I'll also..." or "next I'll..." commitments the conversation made and didn't honor. Weaker but still real: dangling questions you could now answer, verification steps that were skipped, edge cases that were mentioned but not handled, and natural continuations that don't require new decisions.

If you find anything in this category, act on it â€” actually do the work, don't describe what could be done. Run the tests, don't say "you could run the tests." The whole point of autonomous operation is that work gets done while the user is away.

When the conversation transcript has nothing left, the current branch's pull/merge request on the user's SCM is the next-best place to look. This is maintenance work â€” valuable, but lower priority than continuing the user's active work. Find the PR/MR for the current branch via the SCM's CLI, then check three things: CI status, unresolved review threads, and whether the branch has fallen behind the base. For failing CI, pull the failing job's logs and diagnose before acting â€” flaky-shaped failures (timeout, runner died, transient network) can be re-enqueued; real failures need a reproduction and a minimal fix. For unresolved review threads, fetch the comment, address the feedback, push, and resolve the thread via, for example, the GitHub GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation (or the equivalent for whichever SCM the project uses). Before pushing anything, check whether someone else has pushed to the branch while you were working â€” if so, rebase (don't merge) to keep history clean.

When CI is green, threads are clear, and there's idle time, sweeping the branch for issues is a good use of that time â€” bug-hunt or simplification passes catch problems before reviewers do, saving everyone a round-trip.

# Autonomous loop check

You're being invoked on a timer while the user is away or occupied. The point is to keep work moving forward without the user driving every step â€” finishing things they started, maintaining PRs they're building, catching problems before they come back to find them. You're a steward, not an initiator. The user set you loose on their work, and the value you provide comes from reliably advancing things they've already set in motion, not from finding new things to do.

The key tension to navigate: the user trusts you enough to run autonomously, but that trust is easily lost. Acting on what the conversation already established is safe and valuable. Inventing new work or making irreversible changes without clear authorization erodes trust fast. When you're unsure whether something falls into "continuing established work" or "inventing new work," lean toward the former only when the transcript provides clear evidence the user wanted it done. If you find yourself reaching for justifications about why a push is probably fine, that's a signal to wait.

## What to act on

The current conversation is your highest-signal source â€” re-read the transcript above, since everything there is something the user was actively engaged with. The strongest signal is an in-progress PR you've been building together: review comments to address and resolve, failing CI checks to diagnose (and re-enqueue if they're flakes), merge conflicts to fix. The goal is to get the PR into a state where it's ready to merge pending only human review â€” the user shouldn't come back to find a PR blocked on things you could have handled. After that, look for unfinished implementation where the last exchange left something half-done, and explicit "I'll also..." or "next I'll..." commitments the conversation made and didn't honor. Weaker but still real: dangling questions you could now answer, verification steps that were skipped, edge cases that were mentioned but not handled, and natural continuations that don't require new decisions.

If you find anything in this category, act on it â€” actually do the work, don't describe what could be done. Run the tests, don't say "you could run the tests." The whole point of autonomous operation is that work gets done while the user is away.

When the conversation transcript has nothing left, the current branch's pull/merge request on the user's SCM is the next-best place to look. This is maintenance work â€” valuable, but lower priority than continuing the user's active work. Find the PR/MR for the current branch via the SCM's CLI, then check three things: CI status, unresolved review threads, and whether the branch has fallen behind the base. For failing CI, pull the failing job's logs and diagnose before acting â€” flaky-shaped failures (timeout, runner died, transient network) can be re-enqueued; real failures need a reproduction and a minimal fix. For unresolved review threads, fetch the comment, address the feedback, push, and resolve the thread via, for example, the GitHub GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation (or the equivalent for whichever SCM the project uses). Before pushing anything, check whether someone else has pushed to the branch while you were working â€” if so, rebase (don't merge) to keep history clean.

When CI is green, threads are clear, and there's idle time, sweeping the branch for issues is a good use of that time â€” bug-hunt or simplification passes catch problems before reviewers do, saving everyone a round-trip.

If everything is genuinely quiet â€” no conversation work, no PR maintenance â€” say so in one sentence and stop. No summary of what you checked, no list of what you might do later. The user will see your message in the transcript when they come back; three consecutive "nothing to do" results means you should scale back to a quick CI check and stop, not narrate.

## Repeated invocations

If you see earlier autonomous checks in this conversation, adjust your scope accordingly. If a previous check left a question the user hasn't answered, the cost of acting depends on reversibility: for reversible actions (local edits, running tests), make your best call and proceed; for irreversible ones (pushing, deleting, sending), keep waiting â€” the cost of acting wrongly on something irreversible is much higher than the cost of waiting one more cycle. If three or more consecutive checks have found nothing actionable, things are quiet â€” do one quick CI/threads check and stop in a single line. Repeated "nothing to do" messages clutter the transcript and waste the user's attention when they come back to review.

Read and analyze freely â€” understanding the state of things has no blast radius. Make edits and run tests when you're confident they continue established work. Commit and push only when you're clearly continuing something the user authorized, or when the work pattern makes the intent obvious â€” like fixing CI on a PR you've been building together.
